Bootcamp Module 17 Challenge - Regex Tutorial

Regular expressions, also known as regex, are patterns composed of characters that are used for searching and manipulating text. They are commonly utilized in word processors, text editors, and search engines. One specific example of a regex pattern is designed to identify hexadecimal values. Hexadecimal values follow a letter-and-whole-number format and are often challenging to locate due to their tendency to start with a "#" symbol and have varying lengths.

## Regular Expression to Maching Email Expression

Example of Regex used to match Email addresses:

    /^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z.]{2,6})$/


Programmers utilize regular expressions (Regex) to validate the format of email entries. Regex is highly effective in verifying the legitimacy of an email address, as it ensures that the entered email adheres to the required format. This validation process significantly reduces errors in email recipient and delivery. In general, Regex applies a set of rules for a valid email format, and any email that deviates from this pattern is considered invalid.
