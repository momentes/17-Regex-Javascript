Bootcamp Module 17 Challenge - Regex Tutorial

Regular expressions, also known as regex, are patterns composed of characters that are used for searching and manipulating text. They are commonly utilized in word processors, text editors, and search engines. One specific example of a regex pattern is designed to identify hexadecimal values. Hexadecimal values follow a letter-and-whole-number format and are often challenging to locate due to their tendency to start with a "#" symbol and have varying lengths.

## Regular Expression to Maching Email Expression

Example of Regex used to match Email addresses:

    /^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z.]{2,6})$/


Programmers utilize regular expressions (Regex) to validate the format of email entries. Regex is highly effective in verifying the legitimacy of an email address, as it ensures that the entered email adheres to the required format. This validation process significantly reduces errors in email recipient and delivery. In general, Regex applies a set of rules for a valid email format, and any email that deviates from this pattern is considered invalid.

### Anchors

Within this regular expression, there are two distinct anchors: ^ and $.

The ^ anchor is employed to identify and match the commencement of a line or string, while the $ anchor is utilized to locate and match the conclusion of a line or string, taking into consideration the characters that precede it. In the context of this particular regular expression, these anchors are strategically employed to ensure that the entire string aligns with the specified pattern.

In the context of the "Matching an Email" regex, it is imperative that the string commences and concludes with a segment that satisfies the specified pattern ([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z.]{2,6}). The regular expression does not incorporate the quantifier {2,6} preceding the $ character. The omission of this component is intentional, as it pertains to a specialized element known as a quantifier. 

If the input string fails to commence with the specified pattern indicated by the regular expression or does not conclude with the pattern, the regular expression will not yield a match. In order for a successful match to occur, it is essential for the input string to strictly adhere to the prescribed pattern from its beginning to its end

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers play a crucial role in regular expressions as they determine the number of times a specific character or group of characters should be matched. 

'*' (asterisk): Matches the preceding pattern zero or more times.
'+' (plus): Matches the preceding pattern one or more times.
'?' (question mark): Matches the preceding pattern zero or one time.
'{}' (curly brackets): Provide flexibility to specify specific match limits:

{n} (non negative integer) Matches the preceding pattern exactly n number of times.
{n,}: Matches the preceding pattern at least n number of times.
{n, x}: Matches the preceding pattern from a minimum of n number of times to a maximum of x number of times.
